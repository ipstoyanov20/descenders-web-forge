                    Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Noodlecake Studios Inc. collects, uses, and protects your information when you play Descenders and use our services.
                </p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>
                    We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create an account, customize your rider, or contact us for support. This may include your username, email address, gameplay preferences, and device information. We also automatically collect certain information about your device, including your IP address, device type, operating system, and gameplay statistics such as completion times, stunt scores, and progression data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, we may collect information about your interactions with our game, including features used, levels completed, crashes experienced, and time spent playing. This helps us improve the game experience and identify technical issues that need addressing.
                </p>

                <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>
                    We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and improve our services, including personalizing your gaming experience, providing customer support, and developing new features. Your gameplay data helps us balance difficulty levels, improve our procedural generation algorithms, and create better physics simulations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We may also use your information to communicate with you about game updates, new features, tournaments, and other Descenders-related news. You can opt out of promotional communications at any time through your account settings or by contacting us directly.

                </p>

                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>
                    We implement appropriate security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. This includes encryption of sensitive data, secure server communications, and regular security audits. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
                </p>

                <h2>Data Retention</h2>
                <p>
                    We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide our services and fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. Gameplay statistics and progression data are retained to maintain your game experience across sessions and devices. You may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time by contacting our support team.

                </p>

                <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    By accessing, downloading, installing, or using Descenders, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, and any additional terms that may apply to specific features or services. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not use our game or services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Noodlecake Studios Inc. Your use of Descenders is also subject to the terms and conditions of the platform through which you access the game (such as Google Play Store, App Store, Steam, etc.).

                <h2>License to Use</h2>
                <p>
                    We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use Descenders for your personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these terms. This license does not grant you any rights to sell, distribute, modify, or create derivative works based on the game or its content.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The game and all its content, including but not limited to graphics, sounds, music, text, characters, gameplay mechanics, and procedural generation algorithms, are owned by Noodlecake Studios Inc. and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.

                <h2>User Conduct and Prohibited Activities</h2>
                <p>

Prohibited activities include but are not limited to: cheating, hacking, or using unauthorized software to gain unfair advantages; harassing, threatening, or abusing other players; sharing inappropriate, offensive, or illegal content; attempting to reverse engineer, decompile, or extract source code from the game.

                <p>
                    You are also prohibited from: selling, trading, or transferring your account to third parties; using bots, scripts, or automated tools to play the game; exploiting bugs or glitches for personal gain; interfering with the game's servers or security measures; impersonating other players, developers, or staff members.
                </p>

                <h2>User-Generated Content</h2>
                <p>
                    Descenders may allow you to create, share, or submit content such as custom courses, replays, screenshots, or videos. By submitting any content, you grant Noodlecake Studios Inc. a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual license to use, modify, reproduce, and display such content in connection with the game and our services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You represent and warrant that any content you submit is original, does not infringe on third-party rights, and complies with all applicable laws. You remain responsible for your content and may be held liable for any violations or damages resulting from your submissions.
                </p>

                <h2>Virtual Items and In-Game Purchases</h2>
                <p>
                    Descenders may offer virtual items, customizations, or other digital content for purchase. These items have no monetary value outside the game and cannot be exchanged for real money or transferred to other games or platforms. All purchases are final, and we do not provide refunds except as required by applicable law.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Virtual items are licensed, not sold, and remain the property of Noodlecake Studios Inc. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any virtual items or in-game economy features at any time without notice.
                </p>

                <h2>Privacy and Data Collection</h2>
                <p>
                    Your privacy is important to us. Our collection and use of personal information is governed by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these terms by reference. By using Descenders, you consent to the collection and use of your information as described in our Privacy Policy.
                </p>

                <h2>Updates and Modifications</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update, modify, or discontinue Descenders or any of its features at any time without notice. We may also update these Terms of Service periodically. Continued use of the game after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms. If you do not agree to the updated terms, you must stop using the game.
                </p>

                <h2>Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>
                    Descenders is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the game will be error-free, secure, or available at all times. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Noodlecake Studios Inc. disclaims all warranties and shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the game.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our total liability for any claims related to Descenders shall not exceed the amount you paid for the game in the 12 months preceding the claim. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitation of liability, so these limitations may not apply to you.
                </p>

                <h2>Termination</h2>
                <p>
                    We may terminate or suspend your access to Descenders at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Grounds for termination include violation of these terms, illegal activities, or behavior that harms other users or our services. Upon termination, your license to use the game immediately ends, and you must stop all use of our services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You may terminate your account at any time by contacting our support team or using the account deletion feature in the game. Termination does not relieve you of any obligations that accrued before termination.
                </p>

                <h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>
                    These Terms of Service are governed by the laws of [Jurisdiction], without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising from these terms or your use of Descenders shall be resolved through binding arbitration, except where prohibited by law. You waive any right to participate in class action lawsuits or class-wide arbitration.
                </p>

                <h2>Severability and Entire Agreement</h2>
                <p>
                    If any provision of these terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Service, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Noodlecake Studios Inc. regarding Descenders and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.
                </p>
